# AWS Resources Teardown Summary

## Teardown Completed: {{DATE}}

### Overview

All AWS resources for the Manuel project have been successfully deleted to
reduce costs to zero.

### Resources Deleted

#### Core Infrastructure

- ✅ **CloudFormation Stack**: `manuel-dev` - Main application stack
- ✅ **SAM Deployment Artifacts**: All deployment buckets and objects

#### Compute & API

- ✅ **Lambda Functions**: All 15+ functions including:
  - Query Function
  - Manuals Function
  - PDF Page Function
  - Voice Query Function
  - Bootstrap Function
  - Usage Function
  - Auth Functions
  - Health Check Function
- ✅ **API Gateway**: REST API for all endpoints

#### Storage

- ✅ **S3 Buckets**:
  - `manuel-manuals-dev-455574531460` - Manual storage (with versioning)
  - `manuel-audio-dev-*` - Audio file storage
  - SAM deployment buckets
- ✅ **DynamoDB Tables**:
  - Usage tracking table
  - File deduplication table

#### AI/ML Services

- ✅ **Bedrock Knowledge Base**: `FJKRIYWNTL`
- ✅ **Bedrock Data Source**: `ZEFBKCRCMM`
- ✅ **Vector Database**: Associated with Knowledge Base

#### Security & Auth

- ✅ **Cognito User Pool**: Authentication system
- ✅ **Cognito User Pool Client**: App client configuration
- ✅ **IAM Roles**: All Lambda execution roles

#### Networking (if deployed)

- ✅ **VPC Resources**: Subnets, security groups (if Redis was enabled)
- ✅ **VPC Endpoints**: Interface endpoints for AWS services
- ✅ **ElastiCache Redis**: Cache cluster (if deployed)

#### Monitoring & Logs

- ✅ **CloudWatch Log Groups**: All `/aws/lambda/manuel-*` logs
- ✅ **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Monitoring dashboard
- ✅ **CloudWatch Alarms**: All configured alarms
- ✅ **SNS Topics**: Alert notification topics

### Cost Impact

#### Immediate Cost Reduction

- Lambda function invocations: $0
- API Gateway requests: $0
- DynamoDB read/write: $0
- S3 storage and requests: $0
- Bedrock Knowledge Base: $0
- CloudWatch logs ingestion: $0

#### Billing Timeline

- **Immediate**: Most services stop billing immediately
- **Within 1 hour**: CloudWatch logs, VPC endpoints
- **Within 24 hours**: All services reflected in billing

### Data Backup Status

- ⚠️ **Manual PDFs**: Deleted permanently (ensure local backups exist)
- ⚠️ **Usage Data**: Deleted permanently
- ✅ **Code & Configuration**: Safe in GitHub repository

### Redeployment Instructions

To redeploy Manuel in the future:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Build the application
sam build

# 3. Deploy with guided setup
sam deploy --guided

# 4. For production deployment
sam deploy --parameter-overrides-file parameters-production.json

# 5. For Redis-enabled deployment
sam deploy --parameter-overrides-file parameters.json
```

### Teardown Script

A reusable teardown script has been created at:
`backend/teardown-aws-resources.sh`

Usage: `./teardown-aws-resources.sh [stage]`

### Verification Commands

To verify complete teardown:

```bash
# Check CloudFormation stacks
aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE

# Check S3 buckets
aws s3api list-buckets | grep manuel

# Check Lambda functions
aws lambda list-functions | grep manuel

# Check DynamoDB tables
aws dynamodb list-tables | grep manuel
```

### Notes

- All resources have been successfully deleted
- No ongoing charges should occur
- Check AWS Cost Explorer in 24 hours to confirm zero usage
- The codebase remains intact in GitHub for future deployment

### Lessons Learned

1. S3 bucket versioning requires special handling during deletion
2. SAM's `sam delete` command is effective but may need manual cleanup
3. Knowledge Base resources must be deleted before CloudFormation stack
4. Always verify deletion with comprehensive resource checks
