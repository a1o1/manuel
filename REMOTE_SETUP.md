# Remote Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Options

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
brew install gh

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Create repository and push
gh repo create manuel --public --description "Enterprise-grade voice assistant for product manuals using AWS Bedrock"
git remote add origin https://github.com/$(gh api user --jq .login)/manuel.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual GitHub Setup
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `manuel`
3. Description: "Enterprise-grade voice assistant for product manuals using AWS Bedrock"
4. Choose Public/Private as needed
5. Don't initialize with README (we have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

Then run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/manuel.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: GitLab Setup
```bash
# Create on GitLab.com or your GitLab instance
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/manuel.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 4: Azure DevOps
```bash
# Create project in Azure DevOps
git remote add origin https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_PROJECT/_git/manuel
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules
After pushing, configure branch protection:

**GitHub:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks (CI/CD)
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Require conversation resolution
   - Restrict pushes to matching branches

**GitLab:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Push Rules
2. Configure protected branches and merge request requirements

### Repository Settings

**GitHub Repository Settings:**
- **Description**: "Enterprise-grade voice assistant for product manuals using AWS Bedrock"
- **Topics**: `aws`, `serverless`, `voice-assistant`, `bedrock`, `rag`, `enterprise`, `lambda`, `api-gateway`
- **License**: MIT
- **Security**: Enable security advisories and automated security updates

**Repository Structure:**

  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths: [ 'backend/**' ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd backend
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r tests/integration/fixtures/requirements.txt
    
    - name: Run tests

        cd backend
        sam validate
    
    - name: Security scan
      run: |
        cd backend
        bandit -r src/
        safety check -r requirements.txt

  conventional-commits:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
