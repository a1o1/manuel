# iOS Development Setup Guide for Manuel ✅ WORKING

## 🎉 Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The iOS app is successfully running in Expo Go with complete mock functionality.
This guide covers the working setup and how to run the app.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to get the iOS app running:

### 1. Start Metro Bundler

```bash
cd frontend/packages/ios-app
npx expo start --localhost
```

### 2. Install Expo Go on Simulator

1. Open iPhone Simulator (any model)
2. Open Safari and go to: https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779
3. Install Expo Go

### 3. Connect to App

1. Open Expo Go in simulator
2. Tap "Enter URL manually"
3. Enter: `exp://localhost:8081`
4. App loads with mock authentication

### 4. Test Features

- Login with any email/password (mock auth)
- Navigate between tabs (Home, Query, Manuals, Usage, Settings)
- Tap 🔧 button (top-right) to access environment switcher
- Test voice recording interface
- Upload mock files

## 📱 What's Working

### ✅ Core Functionality

- **Authentication**: Mock login/signup with multiple test users
- **Navigation**: All tabs and screens functional
- **Voice Interface**: Recording UI and mock responses
- **File Upload**: Mock PDF management
- **Settings**: User preferences and logout
- **Environment Switcher**: Toggle between mock users and modes

### ✅ Development Features

- **Hot Reload**: Changes reflect immediately
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of mock vs real services

## 🛠 Architecture Overview

### Service Layer

```
src/services/
├── mock/          # ✅ Working mock implementations
├── real/          # 🚧 Stub implementations (ready for backend)
└── interfaces.ts  # Service contracts
```

### Environment Configuration

- **Mock Mode**: All services use simulated data (current)
- **Production Mode**: Ready for real backend integration
- **Hybrid Mode**: Mix mock and real services as needed

### Key Features

- Environment switcher for testing different scenarios
- Mock user switching (John Doe, Jane Smith, Mike Johnson)
- Complete UI flow testing without backend dependencies

## 🔄 Environment Switcher

The **🔧 PRODUCTION** button (top-right) provides:

- **Mode Switching**: Toggle between Mock and Production
- **User Switching**: Test different mock user scenarios
- **Feature Flags**: Individual service control

## 🚀 Next Phase: Backend Integration

The app is now ready for incremental backend integration:

1. **Authentication Service**: AWS Cognito integration
2. **Manuals Service**: Real API calls for file management
3. **Query Service**: Voice processing and RAG responses
4. **Usage Service**: Real analytics and quota tracking

Each service can be enabled independently without breaking the working
foundation.

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash
# Start development
npx expo start --localhost

# Make changes to code
# App hot-reloads automatically

# Test different scenarios via environment switcher
```

### Testing Features

- Use environment switcher to test different user scenarios
- Mock authentication allows testing any login flow
- All UI components functional for design iteration
- Voice recording interface ready for real audio integration

## 📁 Project Structure

```
frontend/packages/ios-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/           # UI components + Environment switcher
│   ├── config/environment.ts # Feature flags (currently all mocks)
│   ├── screens/auth/         # Login, signup flows
│   ├── screens/main/         # Main app functionality
│   ├── services/mock/        # Working mock implementations
│   ├── services/real/        # Ready for backend integration
│   └── navigation/           # React Navigation setup
├── ios/                      # Generated native iOS project
└── assets/                   # App icons and splash screens
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Metro Won't Start

```bash
rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache
npx expo start --clear --localhost
```

### If App Won't Load

1. Check Metro is running on http://localhost:8081
2. Restart Expo Go app completely
3. Re-enter URL: `exp://localhost:8081`

### If Changes Don't Reflect

- Shake simulator (Device → Shake)
- Tap "Reload" in developer menu
- Or press 'r' in Metro terminal

## 🎯 Ready for Backend Integration

The iOS app provides a solid foundation with:

- ✅ Working UI and navigation
- ✅ Mock data for all features
- ✅ Clean service architecture
- ✅ Environment switching capability
- ✅ Development workflow established

Perfect checkpoint for adding real backend services incrementally!
