# iOS Development - Working Setup ✅

## Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The iOS app is now successfully running in Expo Go with full mock functionality
and ready for incremental backend integration.

### ✅ What's Working

**Core App Infrastructure:**

- ✅ iOS project generated with `expo prebuild`
- ✅ Metro bundler running smoothly
- ✅ Expo Go integration working
- ✅ All navigation (auth, main tabs) functional
- ✅ Environment switcher operational

**UI Components:**

- ✅ Login/Signup screens
- ✅ Main navigation (Home, Query, Manuals, Usage, Settings)
- ✅ Environment switcher (🔧 button)
- ✅ Mock authentication flow
- ✅ Voice recording interface
- ✅ File upload UI
- ✅ Settings and user management

**Development Workflow:**

- ✅ Hot reload working
- ✅ Error handling and debugging
- ✅ Clean project structure
- ✅ TypeScript support

### 🛠 Current Configuration

**Environment Mode:** Mock (all services)

- Authentication: Mock users with simulated login
- Manuals: Mock PDF uploads and management
- Queries: Mock voice and text responses
- Usage: Mock quota and analytics data

**Dependencies:** Clean and minimal

- No AWS Amplify (removed due to linking issues)
- Pure React Native/Expo stack
- Ready for incremental backend addition

### 📱 How to Run

1. **Start Metro bundler:**

   ```bash
   npx expo start --localhost
   ```

2. **Connect via Expo Go:**

   - Open Expo Go on iOS simulator
   - Enter URL: `exp://localhost:8081`
   - App loads with mock authentication

3. **Test Features:**
   - Login with any email/password
   - Navigate between tabs
   - Test voice recording UI
   - Upload mock files
   - Switch between mock users via environment switcher

### 🔄 Environment Switcher

Tap the **🔧 PRODUCTION** button (top-right) to:

- Switch between Mock and Production modes
- Change mock users (John Doe, Jane Smith, Mike Johnson)
- Test different data scenarios

### 🚀 Next Phase: Backend Integration

Ready to incrementally add:

1. **Real Authentication** (AWS Cognito)
2. **Real Manuals Service** (API calls)
3. **Real Query Service** (Voice + RAG)
4. **Real Usage Tracking**

Each service can be enabled independently via environment flags without breaking
the working mock foundation.

### 🔧 Key Files Modified

- `src/config/environment.ts` - All mocks enabled
- `src/services/real/*.ts` - Stub implementations ready
- `src/App.tsx` - Environment switcher added
- `index.js` - Clean entry point
- `package.json` - Minimal dependencies

### 📱 Devices Tested

- ✅ iPhone 16 Pro Simulator (iOS 18.5)
- ✅ Expo Go app integration
- ✅ Hot reload and debugging

This is a solid foundation for iOS development with a clean separation between
mock and real services, making backend integration safe and incremental.
