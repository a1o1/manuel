- **Stable Diffusion** (cost-effective option)

### Key Prompts Ready to Use:

#### Application Icon

```
A cheerful Spanish waiter character in the style of 1970s British comedy, wearing a traditional black and white waiter's uniform with bow tie. He has a distinctive thick black mustache, dark hair, and an expressive friendly face. The character is holding out his hand with an open book floating above his palm, glowing softly with warm light. Professional digital illustration style, clean lines, suitable for mobile app icon at various sizes.
```

#### Header Banner

```
A horizontal banner illustration featuring the same cheerful Spanish waiter character, positioned on the left side. He's wearing his traditional black and white waiter's uniform with bow tie and has a thick black mustache. The character is gesturing welcomingly toward the right side where elegant typography reads "Manuel" in a classic serif font. Professional, clean, suitable for mobile app headers, 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### Technical Implementation
